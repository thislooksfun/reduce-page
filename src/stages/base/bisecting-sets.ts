// TODO: Make this smarter. Currently it's incredibly na√Øve, which also means
// that it is more annoying to use than necessary. Take the following example of
// how it works currently. Let's say 'b' is necessary to keep:
// 1. Add some candidate set [a,b]
// 2. Reduce the set [a,b] (removing both) -- this breaks because b is necessary
// 3. Discard that attempt, splitting the set into two: [a] and [b]
// 4. Reduce the set [a], leaving b alone -- a is not required, so this is fine
// Now at this point we know conclusively that b is the problem and needs to
// stay. a is gone, and we already tried removing them both back in step 1. But
// the current logic tries removing a anyway, which is two extra steps (next +
// discard) that the user has to perform.
// Ideally there would be some way of tracking this relationship, so that we can
// skip that extra attempt. It's not necessary for correctness, but it would be
// a nice QoL enhancement.
